design a game class that 
user input: models/"model file name for ac-agent"
user input: number of games (episodes)
user input: probability of opponets type for example [0.5, 0.2,0.3] (50% gets me random_agent, 20% get me a mini-type model openai-mini, 30% get me a large model for example DeepSeek: DeepSeek V3.2) at seat 0 will be the ac_agent we trained 

after play the specified number of games, output return on investment of dimension (number of episode X 4, being ac_agent, random_agent, llm_agent (mini), llm_agent (large)). Return on investment per game is the chips goes back to me from the pool divided by the money respective agent invest into the pool


integrate the game into training process to monitor progress
